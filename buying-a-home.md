2. Search for the Klahanie Association
3. Order the Full Resale Demand Package
4. Provide all the requested information.
5. Submit

Once submitted, the Association will receive email notification and, in turn, will go in and approve the Resale Demand Request. Approval usually takes within 12 to 24 hours of submittal.

Once approved the requester will receive email notification of the approval. At that point, the requester can log into condocerts.com and retrieve all the requested information.

All sales/transactions that take place within Klahanie must go through this service in order to ensure proper transfer of ownership.

<div class="alert alert-warning">
For all Condos or Townhomes in Klahanie, you must order 2 separate Resale Demands/Certificates: one for the condominum or sub-association and one for the Master Association (Klahanie Association). Both these Demands must be ordered or the transfer of ownership will noot take place.

For information of where to order a demand from each sub-association, you will need to contact their specific management company.
