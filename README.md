# Klahanie Website

The Klahanie website is a static site which is generated using Jekyll. 

### Setting up a local environment
We recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/) for your local build environment. 
* Follow the instructions [here](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/) to install a Ruby development environment
* Clone this repository using GitHub Desktop.
* Open a terminal and navigate to the folder you cloned the repository into
* Run `gem install` to install all of the build dependencies
* Once this completes successfully you can build and run a local web server by running `bundle exec jekyll build`

### Creating announcements

To create a new announcement, add a new file to the _announcements folder following this template. When you add an announcement, it automatically adds it to the announcements page. Be sure to update the date, title, and body. The body follows a format called [Markdown](https://commonmark.org/help/), but you can add html as needed.
