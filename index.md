<p>Located on a forested plateau 18-miles east of Seattle, Klahanie comprises 900 acres containing 1,967 single family homes, 718 multifamily residences, and 405 apartment units. The residents are surrounded by natural areas in every direction, including 30-miles of groomed trails, a scenic alpine lake, two swimming pools, three tennis and four basketball courts, four Pickle Ball/ Badminton courts and baseball fields.</p>

<p>Originally launched in 1984, Klahanie grew in stages over the following decade due to the planned involvement of several established home builders, there exists is a variety of home designs, sizes and features that have continued to be very attractive to families 35-years later.</p>

<p>During the past three decades the once rural plateau has become suburban and is now in close proximity to major employers. The Costco world headquarters is four miles away. Microsoft is in the adjacent community to the north and Boeing, Amazon and Starbucks are all within 20 miles. The ski areas of the neighboring Cascade Mountains are an easy 40 freeway minutes to the east.</p>

<p>Due to this highly attractive location and the allure of multiple international companies, Klahanie has also become a comfortable and safe place to live and raise a family for international staff working for these companies. This has created a welcoming attitude for new residents and a refined sense of community that makes Klahanie a special place for kindred spirits regardless if they originally came from India, Ireland, China or just down the road.</p>

<p>Should there be a need for medical help, the renowned Swedish Medical Center and hospital is five minutes away. Shopping opportunities- of course! Right along with restaurants, movies theaters and water sports on nearby Lake Sammamish.</p>
