      "excerpt" : "All property owners in Klahanie are members of the Klahanie Homeowners Association (KHOA). They are part of a major trend in America, where 21.3% of the entire population now live in an HOA. The growth of HOAs has been steady and impressive. In 1970 there were only 10,000 HOAs in America. Last year that number reached 351,000 HOA organizations.The Klahanie Homeowners Association is managed by a Board of Directors elected from among the residents. The Board hires the Association Director to manage the daily activities. The Director has a team of six full-time and one part time employees. Together they oversee the maintenance of all the common areas, manage the two swimming pools and lessons and plan community events. While others make certain that the architectural controls are followed, the assessments are made on a timely basis, bills are paid and most importantly that residents are warmly greeted when they come to the office.The office is located adjacent to the Lakeside Swimming Pool.Governing Documents and FormsEvery HOA has a series of legal documents that define the rights and obligations of both the Association and its owners/residents. These documents establish the mechanisms for governing and funding the Association’s operations, as well as setting forth the rules and standards. When considering the purchase of a home in any HOA, it is imperative that your understand the Governing documents.As with most legal documents, there is a general hierarchy of governing documents.On the largest scale, the federal laws are at the top of all documents, followed by the state and local regulations. The higher a documents place in the hierarchy, the greater its legal weight in a court of law.Each HOA has their own set of governing documents and hierarchy.Covenants, Conditions, and Restrictions (CC&amp;amp;Rs)At the top are the Covenants, Conditions, &amp;amp; Restrictions (CC&amp;amp;Rs), often also referred to as the Declarations. These define the limits or restrictions of the rights of ownership and apply to the land regardless of who later owns it. Each property deed has a declaration recorded which defines the bundle of rights or each owner in the association.The CC&amp;amp;R’s are the most permanent of the legal documents. For Klahanie, it takes a positive vote of two- thirds of all living units (3090 living units) to make a change in the CC&amp;amp;R terms.The CC&amp;amp;R’s provide the following:  Defines the portions of the development owned by the individual owners and those owned by the association  Create interlocking relationships binding all owners to one another and to the association for the purposes of maintaining, governing, and funding the development  Establishes standards, restrictions, and obligations in areas ranging from architectural control to prohibitions on various activities in order to promote harmonious living  Create the administrative framework for the operation and management of the community association-with many of the specific administrative details spelled out in the Bylaws  Provides the mechanism for financial support of the association through assessments  Provides for a transition of control of the association from the developer to the ownersArticles of incorporationKlahanie was legally filed as a not-for-profit corporation. The Articles of Incorporation provide the terms for our non-profit status. The benefits of this filing include:  It limits the liability of individual owners for acts of the association  Entitles the association to the rights granted to all corporations under state law-useful in obtaining insurance or bring suit against another party  Makes it easier to deal with other parties, such as utilities or vendors  Grants the board of directors the same rights as all board members of incorporated entities under state statutesBylawsThe Association Bylaws address topics like:  Requirements for membership in the association  Requirements for membership meetings  Voting rights of member owners  Procedures for electing the board of directors  Procedures for the board to elect officers  General powers and duties of the boardRules and RegulationsKlahanie has a set of rules that are able to be revised as conditions change called the Rules and Regulations. They are approved by the board of directors in order to maintain and enhance Klahanie’s property values, attractiveness and desirability. The rules and regulations also define the process of dealing with complaints due to not following the rulesArchitectural ControlsAligned with the Governing Documents are the Architectural Controls for the association. The authority to enforce these controls is vested in a mandatory committee known as the Architectural Control Committee or ACC and is staffed by community volunteers. Most all the sections in the Architectural Controls deal with standards relating to the home or yards of members. In some cases, a permit must be submitted before any modifications take place in order to enforce consistent standards"

      "excerpt" : "The Klahanie Homeowners Association (KHOA) is a nonprofit organization that exists to make certain the covenants are kept and the common areas are well-maintained. Every homeowner is a member of the KHOA, this relationship is clearly spelled out in the papers you signed and received when you purchased your home. These documents create a legal contract between you and the KHOA.All members have agreed to pay an annual assessment to cover the maintenance and upkeep of all the facilities and the staff to manage the KHOA activities. The current assessment is 800 a year and can be paid quarterly at 200.If you live in a home you are only under the guidance of the KHOA, however, if you live in a condo development, you will have an additional fee paid to your condo HOA to cover maintenance of your building and grounds as well as the KHOA to cover all the common areas and amenities.    What are common areas and what belongs to the City of Sammamish?The KHOA covers all 900 acres in Klahanie, except the streets, sidewalks and Klahanie Park that are owned by the City of Sammamish.As a single-family home owner, you own your individual home and the lot it sits on and you are responsible to maintain both the home and yard in accordance with the guidelines set by the KHOA. Why is this done? The homes in a well maintained neighborhood will increase in value more quickly than a home in a neighborhood with poorly maintained homes and unkempt yards.Compliance- Architectural ControlsThe KHOA has a special section known as the Compliance Department that works with homeowners to help them understand the structure and responsibilities of living in cooperation with the established covenants that apply to all homes in Klahanie. Our Architectural Controls set out the rules for all exterior home improvement projects.The process to make changes to your home or yard.At some point you may want to make changes in your home—paint a different color, repair the fence, add a deck or shed in the backyard, etc. Before you start the work PLEASE do yourself a favor and complete an Architectural Controls Application, or picked up a paper copy in the Association Office. This is the first step in gaining approval of the work you want to have done. The application will either be approved in the office by the Compliance Director, or referred to the ACC committee (consisting of a group of fellow homeowners) for approval or denial—you can always attend the meeting. Once approved and your work is completed, submit a digital photo of the completed work with The Completion Form and the process is completed.What happens when changes to your home are done without ACC approval?Basically, you are on risky grounds. As an example, let’s say that you love a brilliant blue color and decide to have your home painted this bright color. You may love it but your neighbors may not. As soon as it is discovered that the work was done without a permit, you will receive both a 200 fine and a Stop Work order. It gets worse when the Baby Blue is not an approved color. What is likely to happen is that you will be required to repaint your home using one of the many approved home colors. Now you have had to paint the home twice and double your painting budget, received a 200 fine when it would have been so easy and cheap to get approval before you started.What happens if you receive a letter from the Compliance staff asking for your attention to something pertaining to your home or yard?The letter is a notice from the Compliance Director and can pertain to a variety of things that need you attention, such as lawns that need mowing, weeds that need pulling or trash that needs to be removed. This first notice is a friendly reminder to complete the task by a given date. You can solve this by doing the required task and sending back a digital photo as proof that the violation has been removed. As soon as you do this simple step, the violation is removed and nothing further is required from you.If you ignore this first notice, or you don’t send in the photo showing that the work was completed, you will be invited to attend the monthly meeting of the Fine Committee. Now the consequences to you become quite serious! At this point you are likely to receive a 100 fine, plus a 20 fee per day until the work has been completed. There is NO limitation to the number of days that the 20 can be accessed.All of these progressive steps are taken to protect the majority of the homeowners from the few who need additional encouragement to live up to their obligations to maintain their homes and yards. Don’t be one of those people!Learn More  Exterior House Painting Color Palette  Fence Design Specifications  Roof Replacement Rules"

      "excerpt" : "Each owner who plans to rent their home needs to understand the steps to be taken to protect yourself before the rental agreement is started.Carefully read the Rules and Regulations Section 4.11 Rental Properties. You as the home owner are financially responsible for any fines your renter may incur due to not abiding by the the Rules and Regulations.Complete the Rental Registration Form.This form is a requirement and alerts the KHOA staff that you have renters in the home and provides their names, contact information and a copy of the lease so that they can entered in the administrative records and passes to the two pools can be arranged for them.If you have a Property management firm managing the home for you, please include their contact information. This allows our Compliance staff to contact them in case of compliance issues before they become subject to fines.It is critical that you always keep your mailing address and contact information current. One important thing to remember, if your tenant receives a fine and it is mailed to your address and you don’t respond because the address is not current, you will still owe the fine and may also be receiving a 20 a day fee for not responding.If you do not complete the Registration form and rent your home without notifying the KHOA you will receive a fine. By the end of 2019, the fee will be 500. Also renters living in an unregistered home will not be able to use the Klahanie amenities, including the pools until the home is registered.Most fines for noncompliance to Klahanie rules comes from lack of yard maintenance. The Fines Committee how has the option for repeat offenders to require the owner to contact with a professional landscaping firm for 12 months to ensure that your rental home is properly maintained."

      "excerpt" : "A part of the benefit of living in an HOA is the ability to be personally involved in the association planning and guidance. This is done through finding an avenue where you want to volunteer your time and expertise to help on one of the active committees.The list below will describe the committee options so that you can select where and how you want to contribute to the management of the community. Our Governing documents set forth just two mandatory, or standing committees, Architectural Controls and Fine. All the others are set up to enhance the quality of life for all residents.Each committee has a different purpose, and all have at least one Board member and a staff support member. Prior to a meeting, you will receive an agenda from the staff liaison. Most meetings last an hour.### Standing Committees**Architectural Control Committee or ACC** generally meets monthly when there are applications for projects dealing with homes and yards that require consideration and review. The task is to discern the acceptable projects from those that may challenge community norms and standards.**Fines Committee** meets monthly when residents have not responded to the notice from the Compliance department to do something or to cease doing something. It could be as simple as requiring that their lawns be mowed, or that they remove a newly planted vegetable garden in their front yard. When a notice is mailed and no response is received, the resident is invited to the Fine Committee to explain their action or inaction. The committee members decide if a fine is an appropriate way to get the homeowner to abide by the community standards.### Other Committees**Building and Special Projects Committee**, deals mainly with the amenities in Klahanie, from sport courts to trails and playgrounds. What do we need more of? Should the playgrounds be updated? Do we have enough benches and are they in the right places? These committee members can have a big impact on how we all can enjoy the community year-around.**Communications Committee**, works on ways we can communicate the positive messages of what is available here in Klahanie to residents to how we can make this an attractive place for new families to move into.**Redevelopment Committee**, is the newest committee to be launched. This group will create the plans for the future modification and construction of the Klahanie buildings, pools and amenities. How will Klahanie look and what services will be offered over the next five to 25 years?**Social (Events) Committee**, works with the staff events planner to make sure that the planned events each year- 5K race, movie nights, parades and cultural events can each be enjoyed by a wide range of residents. Members of the committee help in bringing forward new ideas and to improve the existing events.## Ad-Hoc CommitteesAd-hoc committees are those that exist for a limited and defined period of time, such as**The Budget Committee**, works with staff and the Board Treasurer to help craft the annual budget that, once approved becomes the operating budget for the coming year. This committee begins in early summer and is over before the Budget Ratification meeting in November.**The Nominating Committee**, helps to run the fall Board of Directors election campaign. The members work to insure that the elections are fair to all candidates and that the community is well informed about the platform of the candidates.## What is the process from here?Send an email to the Community Manager and let us know of your interest in joining a Committee. One of the staff will contact you to let you know which committees have openings and to invite you to attend as a guest to assess your interest in that committee. After the meeting, we encourage you to meet with the committee chair. At that time it should be clear if this is a good fit for you. Each new prospective member of any committee is proposed to the Board and accepted to the committee.Thank you for helping to ensure that Klahanie continues to be the most desirable place to live in Sammamish."
